              Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm the creator of MindBandhu, and honestly? This project means everything to me. As a student who's witnessed friends struggle with mental health challenges, I wanted to build something that could offer real help - not just generic advice, but actual support that feels personal and caring. MindBandhu isn't just code to me; it's my way of saying "you're not alone" to anyone who needs to hear it. Every feature, every response, every resource has been crafted with love and the hope that it might make someone's day just a little bit brighter.
            </p>
